Buss <span class = 'review-tooltip' data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" title="Tour de force!  This book removes the vail from the mechanisms of romance and provides a clear explanation of some of life's most confusing aspects. Dr. Buss does an amazing job uncovering the root of conflict and misunderstanding between the sexes in modern society: The evolution of desire is just significantly slower than the development of civil society. Although a new system has been established, our ancient mating strategy largely remains the same. Male are pre-progammed to want sex with young, beautiful child- bearing females; while females are pre-programmed to want mature, dependable males with resources in committed relationships. However, as the development of productivity and the rise of feminist movement, our instincts are unfitted, or sometimes contradict, with our current ideoogy and culture. We now have to fumble toward a (culturally defined) 'fulfilled relationship' with outdated instincts tailored for survival in the ancient age, resulting in dissonance, confusion and frustration. I can see 'Feminists' hate this book, and I can certainly see why. But Dr. Buss, after spelling out the ugly truth of mating evolution, still believes that diverse mating strategy can be developed and defined by our own. It somehow reminds me of the Junichi Watanabeâ€™s philosophy - 'See the ugly truth as it is, accept it, defy it and still love it. '">[Review]</span></li>
